# What is a System?
***

> "A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. If you look at that definition closely for a minute, you can see that a system must consist of three kinds of things: *elements*, *interconnections*, and a *function or purpose*." - Donella Meadows

## What is Systems Analysis?

The organized study of dynamics and outcomes for the management or design of a system

To do this, we need a few things:
* Identification of the system's elements (and boundaries)
* Relationships between these elements
* Relevant inputs and outputs of interest
