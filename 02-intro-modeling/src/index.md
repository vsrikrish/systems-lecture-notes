We don't need a systems approach when components can be treated individually, e.g., *the whole is no more than the sum of its parts*.

.center[![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](figures/river_diagram.png)]

{{content}}

---

Two factories are discharging a chemical, *chlororadiated ureadicarboxyl* (CRUD), into the Riley River. 

---

Environmental authorities have sampled water from the river and determined that CRUD concentrations exceed the legal standard (1 mg/L). 

---

We want to design a CRUD removal plan to get back in compliance.

**Where do we start? What do we need to know?**

---

# What We Know About CRUD
<hr>


- CRUD decays in the river with first-order decay coefficient $k=0.45 \ \text{d}^{-1}$.

--

- Treating CRUD costs $ \\$50 E^2 \text{ per } 1000 \  m^3,$ where $E$ is the treatment efficiency.

- If $E_i$ is the treatment efficiency at factory $i$, the total treatment cost is
$$C(E_1, E_2) = 50(100)E_1^2 + 50(60)E_2^2,$$

---

# How Much To Remove?
<hr>


Consider the problem at each point of release.

(recall that $1 \ \text{mg/L} = 1 \ \text{g/m}^3 = 10^{-3} \ \text{kg/m}^3$)

---

1. What is the inflow? What is the outflow for a given $E_i$?

2. How does this impact the concentration downstream?

# Mass Balance at Release 1

Factory 1 releases $100 \ \text{kg/d}$ without treatment.

**What is the outflow for a given $E_1$?**

---
class: left

# Mass Balance at Release 1
<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-1-treated.svg)]

--

Total CRUD after factory 1 release: $\color{blue}\text{100} + \color{red} 1000(1-E_1) \color{black} \ \text{kg/d}$

# Mass Balance at Release 2

But this isn't the inflow for release 2...

# Mass Decay
<hr>


Given a decay rate of $k = 0.45 \ \text{d}^{-1}$:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -0.45 M \Rightarrow \frac{dM}{M} = -0.45 dt$$
$$\int_{M(0)}^{M(T)} \frac{dM}{M} = -0.45 \int_0^T dt$$
$$\ln\left(\frac{M(T)}{M(0)}\right) = -0.45 T$$
$$M(T) = M(0) \exp\left(-0.45 T\right)$$


---
class: left

# Mass Decay
<hr>


So now we know that after $t$ days, 
$$M(t) = M_0 \exp \left(-0.45 T \right).$$

--

But we want to know $M(x)$, where $x$ is in distance, since we know the distance between factories 1 and 2 is $10 \ \text{km}$. 

---
class: left

# Mass Decay
<hr>


Since the velocity of the river is $25 \ \text{km/d}$:

$$M(x) = M_0 \exp\left(-0.45 (x/25)\right), \quad x \leq 10 \ \text{km},$$

and simplifying and plugging in $x = 10$ and $M_0$, the inflow of CRUD at the factory 2 release is:

$$M(10) = (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) \ \text{kg/d}.$$

---

<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-2.svg)]

class: left

# Mass Balance at Release 2
<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-2-treated.svg)]

This means that after factory 2 releases CRUD, the concentration is:

$$(1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2) \ \text{kg/d}.$$

---
class: left

# Mass Balance at Release 2
<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-2-treated.svg)]

We can use this as an initial condition for $M(x), x > 10$ (we don't have to do this in detail):

$$M(x) = M_1 \exp\left(-0.45 (x/25)\right), \quad x > 10,$$
where $M_1 = (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2)$.

# ...Now What?
<hr>

Our next steps depend on what we're trying to do: is our model descriptive or prescriptive?

--

- *Descriptive*: Use the dynamical equations to simulate the CRUD concentrations for varying levels of $0 \leq E_1, E_2 \leq 1$ and compare those to the costs and the legal limit.

--

- *Prescriptive*: Turn these equations and limits into constraints and find the values of $E_1$ and $E_2$ which minimize costs while staying in compliance (we'll return to this later!).
