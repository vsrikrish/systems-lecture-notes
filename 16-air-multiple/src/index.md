# How to Combine Concentrations From Multiple Sources?
<hr>

--

Additive:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Concentration} &= \frac{M_1 + M_2 + M_3}{V} \\\\
&= \frac{M_1}{V} + \frac{M_2}{V} + \frac{M_3}{V} \\\\
&= C_1 + C_2 + C_3
\end{aligned}$$

# Developing Constraints
<hr>

Want to model exposure as a function of the emissions $Q_i$. How?

--

Write $C_i(x,y) = Q_it_i(x,y)$, where the $t_i$ is the transmission factor

$$t_i(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi u \sigma\_y \sigma\_z} \exp\left(\frac{-y^2}{2\sigma\_y^2} + \frac{H^2}{\sigma\_z^2}\right)$$

--

This turns exposure constraints linear as a function of $Q_i$: for a receptor $j$ (with fixed location $(x_j, y_j)$),

$$\text{Exp}\_j = \sum\_i Q\_i t\_i(x\_j, y\_j) \leq 150\ \mu\text{g/m}^3$$

# Calculating Transmission Factors

Let's assume we're in stability class C. Then we have $\sigma_y = 104x^{0.894}$ and
$\sigma_z = 61x^{0.911}$ (regardless of distance).

# Calculating Transmission Factors

Now we can write a function:

```@example air
# delta_x, delta_y should be in m
# should subtract receptor from source for upwind check
function transmission_factor(delta_x, delta_y, u, H)
    if delta_x <= 0
        tf = 0.
    else
        sigma_y = 104 * (delta_x / 1000)^0.894
        sigma_z = 61 * (delta_x / 1000)^0.911
        tf_coef = 1/(2 * pi * u * sigma_y * sigma_z)
        tf = tf_coef * 
            exp((-0.5 * (delta_y / sigma_y)^2) + (H / sigma_z)^2)
    end
    return tf

# Optimization Formulation: Decision Variables
<hr>

What are our decision variables?

--

Let's use: $R_i$, fraction of emissions reduced at source $i$. 

Then $Q_i = (1-R_i)E_i$, where $E_i$ is the emissions corrected to the appropriate units).

```@example air; continued=true
using JuMP
using HiGHS

air_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
@variable(air_model, 0 <= R[1:3] <= 1)
```

$$\begin{aligned}
\min\_{R\_i} Z &= \sum_i RemCost_i \times DayEmis_i \times R_i \\\\

# Optimization Constraints

- Exposure Constraints:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Exp}\_j = \sum\_i Q\_i t\_i(x\_j, y\_j) &\leq 150\ \mu\text{g/m}^3 \\\\
\Rightarrow \sum\_i E\_it\_{ij}(1-R\_i) &\leq 150 \times 10^{-6}

```@example air; continued=true
E = [400, 2000, 1200]
@constraint(air_model, exposure[j in 1:5], 
    sum([E[i] * tf[i, j] * (1-R[i]) for i in 1:3]) <= .00015)

# Let's Optimize!

```@example air
set_silent(air_model)
optimize!(air_model)

**Does this make sense?**

# Untreated Exposure

```@example air
(E .* tf) .* 1e6 # in micrograms/m^3

# Reduced Exposure

```@example air
(E .* (1 .- value.(R)) .* tf) .* 1e6
```

---
# Why This Plan Makes Sense
<hr>

Basically (ignoring source 1, which is constrained by receptor 2):

We *could* reduce emissions from source 2 by ~85% to comply at receptor 5, but then would also need to reduce source 3's emissions by 100%, at a cost of **~$128,304**.

This plan involves eliminating all of source 2's emissions, but only 75% of source 3's, at a cost of **$124,416**.

# Airsheds and Box Models
<hr>

.left-column[
**Box models** are all about mass-balance. Denote by $C$ (g/m$^3$) the concentration in box, $E$ (g/s) the emissions rate within the box;, $u$ (m/s) the wind speed, and by $L, W, H$ the box dimensions (m)

# Steady-State Box Model
<hr>

.left-column[
First, consider a steady-state box, $\Delta m = 0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= \dot{m}\_{in} - \dot{m}\_{out} + E \\\\
&= u WH C\_{in} - u WH C + E \\\\
C &= C\_{in} + \frac{E}{uWH}
\end{aligned}$$

# Quick Example
<hr>

A box surrounding a city has dimensions $W = 4km$, $L = 8km$, $H=1km$. The upwind concentration of $CO$ is 5 $\mu\text{g/m}^3$ and the wind is moving at 2 m/s. The emission rate of $CO$ within the city is $3 \mu\text{g/(s} \cdot \text{m}^2)$. What is the concentration of $CO$ over the city?

--

$$E = (3 \mu\text{g/(s} \cdot \text{m}^2))(8000 \text{m})(4000 \text{m}) = 9.6 \text{g/s}$$

--

$$C = (5 \mu\text{g/s}) + \frac{9.6 \text{g/s}}{(2 \text{m/s})(4000 \text{m})(1000 \text{m})} = 6.2 \mu\text{g/s}$$

---
# Emissions Credits and Trading
<hr>

When using a "box" representation, all that matters is the total emissions not exceeding a certain level within the box.

Opens the door for emissions credits/trading as a market-based mechanism vs. a pure regulation.

--

**What are some pros and cons of these approaches?**

---
# Sources and Sinks
<hr>

Of course, we could also have sinks (including reactions) which absorb or consume some of the contaminant.

How would this change our simple box model?

--

Modify $E$ as net emissions, sources - sinks (might have to model these processes more explicitly, which adds complexity).


---
# Multi-Box Models
<hr>

Box models get more interesting when multiple boxes are combined (think your dissolved oxygen example from the simulation unit).

This allows for 2d or 3d fate & transport modeling with potentially heterogeneous advection, mixing, and source/sink rates.

But can be computationally expensive over large regions: need to loop and evaluate over many boxes.

---
# Key Takeaways
<hr>

- Gaussian Plume: all upwind sources can affect downwind receptors.
- Assumptions may not generally hold --- how much does this matter?
- Box models allow for more flexibility when more detailed mass-balance is required, but are computationally more expensive to combine over large domains.
