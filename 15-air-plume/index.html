# Modeling Air Pollution


<hr>


There are many approaches to modeling concentrations of pollutants/chemicals, including:


1. Point sources/receptors (plume/puff models)
2. Analyzing an "airshed" (box models)

# Point Sources/Receptors


<hr>


In this case, we're concerned about the dispersal from a point source: .center[![Source-Receptor Geometry](figures/air-pollution.png)]

# Gaussian Plume Model


<hr>


For an elevated source **without reflection**:


$$
C(x,y,z) = \frac{Q}{2\pi u\sigma_y \sigma_z} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y^2}{\sigma_y^2} + \frac{(z - H)^2}{\sigma_z^2}\right)\right].
$$

# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


We use the **advective-diffusion equation** to describe the mass-balance:


$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = [D + K] \nabla^2 C - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{\nabla} C $$

where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $K$ is the dispersion coefficient due to turbulent mixing.

# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{\nabla} C  - [D + K] \nabla^2 C  = 0
$$


Assumptions:


--


  * Steady-state, e.g. $\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = 0$


---




# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{\nabla} C  - [D + K] \nabla^2 C  = 0
$$


Assumptions:


  * Wind only in the $x$-direction:


$$
\vec{u} \cdot \vec{\nabla} C = u_x \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} + \cancel{u_y \frac{\partial C}{\partial y}} + \cancel{u_z \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}
$$


---




# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{\nabla} C  - [D + K] \nabla^2 C  = 0
$$


Assumptions:


  * Turbulence $>>$ diffusion, e.g. $K >> D$, and $K$ is unimportant along $x$-direction:


$$
-[\cancel{D} + K] \nabla^2 C = \cancel{K\_{xx}} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} + K\_{yy} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} + K\_{zz} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2}
$$


---




# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


With these assumptions, the equation simplifies to:


$$
u \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = K\_{yy} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} + K\_{zz}\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2}
$$

# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


Solving this PDE:


$$
C(x,y,z) = \frac{Q}{4\pi x \sqrt{K\_{yy} + K\_{zz}}} \exp\left[-\frac{u}{4x}\left(\frac{y^2}{K\_{yy}} + \frac{(z-H)^2}{K\_{zz}}\right)\right]
$$


--


To deal with $K$, substitute:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma\_y^2 &= 2 K\_{yy} t = 2 K\_{yy} \frac{x}{u} \\\\
\sigma\_z^2 &= 2 K\_{zz} \frac{x}{u}
\end{aligned}
$$


---




# Gaussian Plume Model Derivation


<hr>


Solving this PDE:


$$
\begin{aligned}
C(x,y,z) &= \frac{Q}{4\pi x \sqrt{K\_{yy} + K\_{zz}}} \exp\left[-\frac{u}{4x}\left(\frac{y^2}{K\_{yy}} + \frac{(z-H)^2}{K\_{zz}}\right)\right] \\\\
\Rightarrow C(x,y,z) &= \frac{Q}{2\pi u \sigma\_y \sigma\_z} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y^2}{\sigma\_y^2} + \frac{(z-H)^2}{\sigma\_z^2}\right) \right],
\end{aligned}
$$


which looks like a Gaussian distribution probability distribution if we restrict to $y$ or $z$.

& \quad \left[\exp\left(\frac{-(z-H)^2}{2\sigma\_z^2}\right) + \exp\left(\frac{-(z+H)^2}{2\sigma\_z^2}\right) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

# Final Model: Elevated Source with Reflection


<hr>


Assumptions:


1. Steady-State
2. Constant wind velocity and direction
3. Wind >> dispersion in $x$-direction
4. No reactions

# Gaussian Plume Example


<hr>


SO$_2$ is emitted at a rate of $100 \text{g/s}$ from the top of a $100 \text{m}$-high chimney. The plume initially rises $10 \text{m}$ before being convected horizontally by a wind speed of $15 \text{m/s}$. What is the centerline ground-level concentration $3 \text{km}$ downwind if at this distance $\sigma_y = 80 \text{m}$ and $\sigma_z=30 \text{m}$ under current meteorological conditions?


$$
\begin{aligned}
C(x,y,z) = &\frac{Q}{2\pi u \sigma\_y \sigma\_z} \exp\left(\frac{-y^2}{2\sigma\_y^2} \right) \times \\\\
& \quad \left[\exp\left(\frac{-(z-H)^2}{2\sigma\_z^2}\right) + \exp\left(\frac{-(z+H)^2}{2\sigma\_z^2}\right) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

# Key Takeaways


<hr>


  * Regulatory controls (or lack thereof) on air pollutants (Clean Air Act, etc) and greenhouse gas emissions (patchwork)
  * Concentrations of contaminants can be modeled in several ways, depending on the goal and assumptions.
  * Point source/receptor: Gaussian plume is common approach.
